MMAPULA MARKETING WEBSITE.
PROBLEM STATEMENT.
Event planners and organizers often struggle to find sufficient ways of spreading information about planned out events to the public. Use of social media to dispense information about events whether educational, recreational or professional has proved not to be effective enough as not all the target audience for such use social media. Quite a number of people who initially would have been willing to attend a given event only come to know about that event after it has already happened. This not only affects the individual but also jeopardizes attendance numbers at events.

SOLUTION.
In order to fill the evident void, I propose and introduce Mmapula Marketing Website. This Website provides a platform for event organizers to get word out about their events and provides for individuals willing to attend events to get all the relevant information. This Website also allows for individuals to show their interest in a certain event. This will most definitely go a long way in assisting event organizers plan for the event as it could be used to know estimated turn outs.
